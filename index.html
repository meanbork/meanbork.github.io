    <h1>Janky Raspberry Pi Surveillance Camera</h1>
    <section class="block">
      <p>Stuff I NEEDED: Raspberry Pi 3 B+, USB 2.0 extender male to female, Raspberry Pi camera V2 
        (I would use something nicer in the future - the max resolution is 8 mega pixels and ribbon cable blows).</p>
      <p>Following are the steps I took to complete the project.</p>
      <p>1: Install Raspbian Lite
         2: After installing Lite, go ahead and Google “Raspbian Lite with RPD/LXDE/XFCE/MATE/i3/Openbox/X11 GUI”. 
         Follow the steps and install the GUI you desire.
         3: Restart. Open terminal. Type: ifconfig and jot down your IP. You are going to need it.
         4: Type: sudo apt-get install motion
         5: Check your camera's status. If you are using camera connected to USB port, Type: lsusb
         *** If you are using V2 or similar stuff, Type: raspistill -o test.jpg
         *** Not working? Type: sudo rasp-config, go to interface options and fiddle with the camera settings
         6: Type: sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf
         *** daemon off -> daemon on
         *** width 320 -> 640
         *** height 240 -> 480
         *** framerate 2 -> 100
         *** ffmpeg_output_movies on -> off (Turn it off so you stop recording & saving video files)
         *** stream_maxrate 1 -> 100
         *** stream_localhost on -> off
         *** webcontrol_localhost on -> off
         *** save and exit motion.conf
         *** Tip: To look for keywords use :CTRL+W
         7: Type: sudo nano /etc/default/motion
         *** Start_motion_daemon=no -> yes
         8: Type: sudo nano /etc/rc.local
         *** Write in "sudo motion"

         9: Type: sudo chmod 777 /var/lib/motion
         10: This is going to depend on your router & ISP. I had to make a free account at "www.noip.com" to create DDNS
         11: Either way - Go to your router and designate static IP (Your Raspberry Pi) for portforwarding.
         *** Internal port number = 8081. External port number = Your choice
         12: Restart
         13: Go to your browser (Any device with internet) and type in your address. Mine was meanbork.ddns.net:1234
         Someone famous in Source Title
         There you have it. Your own janky surveillance camera.</p>
      <p>Advisory: It is best to complete the DDNS process on your router and rotate port number.
         Also if you don't plan on changing camera's setting remotely, just leave the "Webcontrol_localhost on"</p>

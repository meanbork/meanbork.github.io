      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Stuxnet: Worm often referred to as the first "Cyber super weapon". The worm specifically targets industrial control systems. 
        It was revealed to have been a weapon created by the US and Israeli governments against Iranian nuclear facilities. 
        Stuxnet exploits a vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler service to spread over networked machines. 
        It "prints" two files, winsta.exe, a dropper in the system folder and one additional file, sysnullevnt.mof.</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Date of discovery: 2010/06/17. Place of origin: USA, Israel. Language source: C++, C. File type: .dll, .tmp</p>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Navidad: Mass mailing worm that displays the various error messages in Spanish. The worm is capable of making the computer inoperable. 
        The virus arrives in an email that appears to be a reply. When executed, it displays error messages "UI". 
        The virus then preceeds to copy itself to Winsvrc.vxd and change the registry key values. This will cause the computer to prompt the user to find Winsvrc.exe with no avail.
        The Navidad virus will then keep mailing itself using MAPI protocol with NAVIDAD.EXE as an attachment.</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Date of discovery: 2000/11/03. Place of origin: South America. Language source: C++. File type: .exe</p>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">WannaCry: Catagorized as ransomware cryptoworm. Specifically targets Windows OS. 
      The Virus propogates by using EternalBlue - Exploit from older Windows systems, more specifically, the Server Message Block (SMB).
      The SMB protocol helps various nodes to communicate on network. Once infected, the virus attempts to reach gibberish URL / domain.
      If successful, WannaCry will shutdown. Unsuccesful, the virus will create "mssecsvc2.0" which then begins to extract binary resource to
      encrypt. The user is demanded of bitcoin payment to recover their system, the ransom will double if the timer expires.
      </h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Date of discovery: 2017/05/12. Place of origin: North Korea. Language source: C++. File type: .wcry, .bak, .doc, .mpg, .pdf</p>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Shamoon: Also known as W32.DistTrack. Specifically targets 32-bit Windows NT kernel. The virus can spread to other computers on the network. 
        Once infected, the virus sends the file locations to the attacker, and the virus deletes the files or replaces with graphic images. Eventually, the virus overwrites the master boot section. 
        Making the computer unusuable. The virus was designed to attack the Saudi government, and national oil company - Saudi Aramco.
